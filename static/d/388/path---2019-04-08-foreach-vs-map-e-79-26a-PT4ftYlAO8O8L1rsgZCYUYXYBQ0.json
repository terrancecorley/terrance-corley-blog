{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>.forEach</h2>\n<p>If you're fairly new to JavaScript or are now just coming across the .forEach and .map methods, you might be a little confused on the differences and when each one is appropriate. Simply put, <code>.map</code> will make a copy of the specified array and run your specified function on each item in the array and will return those items into the new array, which you can store in a variable. <code>.forEach</code> will run your specified function on each item in the array but does <em>not</em> return a new array, it modifies the original one.  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    let someArray = [1, 2, 3];\n    someArray.forEach(function(currentNumber) {\n        currentNumber++;\n    });\n\n    console.log(someArray); // [2, 3, 4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Drink more water and make healthier food choices. That's a cliché these days, but clichés are clichés for a reason, there is usually some truth to them! You don't need to track your water and calorie intake either to make a healthy change. What I do is I'll have water with my breakfast and lunch and I'll allow myself something else to drink for dinner, and I make sure to carry a water bottle with me wherever I go. As far as food, just eat out less. Look up some simple healthy recipes online and go shopping. You'll most likely save money, you'll feel better after the meal, and there are plenty of healthy meals you can whip up within 10-15 minutes.</p>\n<h2>.map</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    let someArray = [1, 2, 3];\n    let newArray = someArray.map(function(currentNumber) {\n        currentNumber++;\n    });\n\n    console.log(someArray); // [1, 2, 3]\n    console.log(newArray); // [2, 3, 4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've been working as a software engineer on at my company for the last 4 months. When I'm stuck on something at work, or even if I just want a second opinion I don't hesitate to reach out to a co-worker. Now that doesn't mean I immediately run to them when I hit a wall, I still try to climb that wall, but if I'm spending over 30 minutes trying to debug and I'm using a lot of energy trying to figure out something, sometimes some of that energy can be saved, especially if you are fortunate enough to be on a collaborative team. Asking for help doesn't make you any \"less than\" as a dev, it builds communication skills, allows you reserve some energy you would've continued to exhuast, and next time you climb a similar wall you'll be better equipped. Don't forget to show thanks to those that help you. :)  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my post today if you've made it this far! Please forgive any potential grammatical errors as I'm writing this before work and am challenging myself to post every weekday, but I don't have the time to proofread as thoroughly as I'd like to today. Happy coding!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"JavaScript: .forEach vs .map","content":"Web Developer Terrance Corley explains the difference between the forEach and map methods in JavaScript."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-04-08-foreach-vs-map/"}}
